auto-setup is a short script written in bash (Sorry zsh and fish users, make your own) that I've used for setting up Arch (Debian and Gentoo versions are now available) based systems for a long time now, and I might as well upload it to github

To use auto-setup run the following commands: 

sudo chmod +x auto-setup.sh

./auto-setup.sh



  All auto-setup does is, makes a github and .fonts directory

  Installs a required font for ST

  ## Clones my repos: bspwm, sxhkd, bashrc, and myfonts

  It proceeds to install & configure these programs

  I am planning on adding more to this script in the future, you are free to fork it and make it your own.

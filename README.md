# auto-setup
auto-setup is a short script written in bash that I've used for setting up Arch based systems for a long time now, and I might as well upload it to github

To use auto-setup run the following commands: 

sudo chmod +x auto-setup.sh

./auto-setup.sh



  All auto-setup does is, makes a github and .fonts directory

  Installs a required font for ST

  Clones my repos: dwmconf, stconf, slstatusconf, and myfonts

  It proceeds to build these programs

  I am planning on adding more to this script in the future, you are free to fork it and make it your own.
